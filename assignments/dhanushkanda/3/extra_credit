Extra credit: It's turtles all the way down...

An interesting xkcd comic I found online: https://xkcd.com/1416/

Turtles all the way down is a concept of the problem of infinite regress. For instance lets say the whole earth rests on the back of a turtle. This turtne rests on the back of an even larger turtle. Then this is supported by another larger turtle below it and it is an indefinite collection of turtles.
